# T4: Trainable TrainTrack Tracker

This is the trainable traintrack tracker, a tracker which tracks trains on train tracks and trains to track tracks which trains use.

This project uses our very own flavour of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which we like to refer to as SI, or, Superficial Intelligence.
We have implemented machine 1earning by direct programming—machines in the t4 network will save a tiny amount of data, reformat it slightly and present it back to the user through a fancy-looking GUI.
One might even argue that what’s been done here isn’t machine learning at all, and this would be entirely correct—we have implemented machine 1earning, note that the ‘1’ here represents the maximum number of datapoints we consider when extrapolating any result.
